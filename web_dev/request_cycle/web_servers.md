# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux is open-source and the creators of the Linux OS feel that it's important to trust that the user knows what they're doing, i.e. make it possible for users to do anything they want with the OS rather than asking for confirmation after a command, or preventing developers from affecting certain parts of the system.

# What is a VPS (virtual private server)?

A VPS is basically a physical server environment that is partitioned into different containers, each of which functions as a separate server with its own specifications and requirements.

# What are the advantages of using a VPS?

Since a VPS is partitioned into different separate servers, you can switch between the different environments without worrying about side effects or accidentally breaking an environment.

# Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Because of potential security issues (a virus will have access to everything in the system, for example) and user error (there's a higher risk that a mistake you make can have a bigger negative effect on your whole system).
