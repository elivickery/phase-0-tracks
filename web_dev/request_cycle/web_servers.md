## Web Servers

# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux is open-source and the creators of the Linux OS feel that it's important to trust that the user knows what they're doing, i.e. make it possible for users to do anything they want with the OS rather than asking for confirmation after a command, or preventing developers from affecting certain parts of the system.

# What is a VPS (virtual private server)?

A VPS is a Virtual Private Server - it's basically a hosting environment that mimics a dedicated server within a shared hosting environment.

# What are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is more flexible than shared hosting because you can set the specifications of the server (memory and bandwidth allocation, operating system, etc.)

# Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Because of potential security issues (a virus will have access to everything in the system, for example) and user error (there's a higher risk that a mistake you make can have a bigger negative effect on your whole system).
