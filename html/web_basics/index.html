    <p>^ See that bird up there? It's a puffin. <em>Why do they walk like that? Who knows.</em></p>
    <strong>Here are a few facts about puffins:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Puffins are "any of three small species of alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula with a brightly coloured beak". (Thanks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.)</li>
        <li>Baby puffins are called <em>pufflings</em>.</li>
        <li>Puffins only have brightly colored beaks during the breeding season; afterwards, the colored part falls off, leaving behind a dull, regular beak.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Puffins are often hunted for their meat. Here are a couple facts about puffin hunting:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Puffins are hunted by a technique called "sky fishing", which involves catching low-flying birds with a big net.</li>
