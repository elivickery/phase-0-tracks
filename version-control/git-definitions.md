# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.


* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you to save snapshots of files as you work on them to create a progressive history of your work, so you don't permanently delete any code that you may decide you need later in your project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Creating a branch gives you a copy of the project you're working on where you can make changes and work on a specific feature without affecting the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point containing files you've chosen, that you can return to later if needed.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when competing changes are made to the same line of a file in different branches of the same repo.  When you try to merge the two branches, this can cause a problem because git doesn't know how to update the line.
